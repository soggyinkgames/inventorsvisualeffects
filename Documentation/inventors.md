# WILHELM WEBER 1804-1891 (WEBER)
Researching magnetism with the great mathematician and astronomer Karl Friedrich Gauss in the 1830s, German physicist Wilhelm Weber developed and enhanced a variety of devices for sensitively detecting and measuring magnetic fields and electrical currents. Included among these devices was the electrodynamometer, which was capable of measuring electric current, voltage or power through the interaction of the magnetic fields of two coils. Utilizing this device, Weber experimentally validated André-Marie Ampère’s force law. Weber began developing a similar system of electric units around 1840 after Gauss developed a system of magnetic units expressed in terms of length, mass and time in the early 1830s.

# MARIA TELKES (TELKES) 1900-1995
Biophysicist and inventor, born in Hungary, Maria Telkes’ accomplished career in solar energy research and development earned her the nickname “the Sun Queen.” Telkes earned her B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Budapest. She had just become an instructor there when a 1924 visit to the United States changed her life. She relocated to Ohio the next year, joining the Cleveland Clinic Foundation as a biophysicist. Her work there with George Washington Crile, a distinguished surgeon, led to the development of a photoelectric device to measure brain waves.

# PHOEBE SARAH HERTHA AYRTON (AYRTON) 1854-1923
Phoebe Sarah Hertha Ayrton was a British engineer, mathematician, physicist and inventor, and suffragette. Known in adult life as Hertha Ayrton, born Phoebe Sarah Marks, she was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society for her work on electric arcs and ripple marks in sand and water.

# THOMAS ALVA EDISON (ALVA) 
Thomas Alva Edison invented the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and more than 1,000 other things. Edison is best known for inventing the incandescent light bulb in 1879.

# ANDRE-MARIE AMPERE 1775-1836 (AMPERE)
Although he was not the first person to observe a connection between electricity and magnetism, André-Marie Ampère was the first scientist to attempt to theoretically explain and mathematically describe the phenomenon. His contributions laid the groundwork upon which the science of electrodynamics (a term coined by Ampère, but now more commonly referred to as electromagnetics) has been built.

# KATHERINE BURR BLODGETT (BURR)
Katharine Burr Blodgett was an American physicist and chemist known for her work on surface chemistry, in particular her invention of "invisible" or nonreflective glass while working at General Electric. She was the first woman to be awarded a PhD in physics from the University of Cambridge, in 1926.

# SVANTE ARRHENIUS (ARRHENIUS) 1859-1927
Svante Arrhenius was born in Vik, Sweden, and became the first native of that country to win the Nobel Prize. The award for chemistry was bestowed to him in honor of his theory of electrolytic dissociation. In its incipient form, which appeared in his doctoral dissertation, the theory was poorly received by his professors. The barely passing grade that he was given for the dissertation did not discourage Arrhenius, however, and his persistence eventually led to the general acceptance of many of his ideas regarding electrolytes, acids, bases and chemical reactions.

# ESTHER SANS TAKEUCHI 1980 (TAKEUCHI)
In the mid-1980s, Takeuchi took on the challenge of increasing the power of batteries used to power implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), tiny devices placed inside patients needing an occasional shock to regulate heartbeat. The trouble was the meager voltage in these batteries was barely powerful enough to do the job; a battery ran out after only a year, requiring major surgery to implant a new one. 
Takeuchi changed all that through research at Greatbatch, Inc. She employed new cathode materials, highly conductive electrolytes, and a novel cell design that enabled a new type of lithium/silver vanadium oxide (Li/SVO) battery the same size as the previous model—and one million times more powerful. Instead of lasting a year, Takeuchi’s battery lasted five—newer generations last even longer. More than 300,000 ICDs are implanted each year to help keep heartbeats healthy.
